# Quiz App - Master Plan

## üìå App Overview & Objectives

A **Quiz App** that allows users to test their knowledge on various skills. Users select a skill, difficulty level, and number of questions. The app then generates a quiz dynamically using an LLM and provides real-time feedback on their answers.

## üéØ Target Audience

- Students, professionals, and knowledge enthusiasts.
- Users looking for skill-based quiz tests.
- People wanting an instant quiz without prior setup.

## ‚ú® Core Features & Functionality

1. **User Authentication** (Login/Signup)
2. **Quiz Generation**
   - User selects a **skill**, difficulty level, and number of questions.
   - System sends a predefined **structured prompt** to the LLM.
   - LLM returns a **JSON-based quiz structure**.
3. **Quiz Interface**
   - **Single-question-per-screen** format.
   - Timer for each quiz.
   - Supports **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)** and **Q&A type questions**.
4. **Scoring System**
   - 1 point per correct answer.
   - Instant feedback on correctness after answering.
5. **One-Time Quiz Attempts**
   - Users can take a quiz only once; no quiz history is stored.

## üîß High-Level Tech Stack Recommendations

### Backend:

- **.NET Core** (Efficient API handling, scalable architecture)
- **Entity Framework Core** (Database ORM for handling quiz data)

### Frontend:

- **React + Redux** (For a fast and dynamic UI with state management)
- **TailwindCSS** (For clean & simple UI design)

### LLM Integration:

- **Mistral 7B** (Recommended Open-Source LLM for structured JSON responses)
- **Alternative:** Llama 2 (if higher accuracy is needed)
- **Fallback:** GPT-3.5 Turbo (if OpenAI API is an option)

### Database:

- **PostgreSQL / MySQL** (Structured storage for user & quiz data)
- **Redis** (For caching frequently used quiz formats if needed)

| password    | Hash      | Encrypted password    |
| created\_at | Timestamp | Account creation time |

### Quizzes Table

| Column Name   | Type      | Description             |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| id            | UUID      | Unique quiz ID          |
| user\_id      | UUID      | User who took the quiz  |
| skill         | String    | Skill category          |
| difficulty    | String    | Easy/Medium/Hard        |
| questions     | JSON      | Quiz structure from LLM |
